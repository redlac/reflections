What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

All of the required git files are placed in the current directory. No commits are made automatically. The ".git" files are needed in order for the git commands to work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an itermediate area between the working directory and the repository, it sets up which files are going to be commited. I think it's used as an organizational tool, so you don't have to commit single files one at a time to the repository, and can instead group related files together and commit them together.
